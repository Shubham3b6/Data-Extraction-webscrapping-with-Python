# Data-Extraction-webscrapping-with-Python
I have make a script in python to scrap all the product details for multiple E-commerce platform like Meesho ,Ebay ,etc. And Scrape Data which is visible on search page from the search string .
I ask users to enter the count of how many pages (then enter number of pages by yourself) of data we want to scrap then scrap only from search pages like :- Product URLs, Price ,Title  and Image URL and append the data in excel file.
Scraping product details from product pages for every URLs that we got from the first script and save it into an excel file.
